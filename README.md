# Assessment-of-Variation-in-NDVI-and-Canopy-Temperature-in-Bread-Wheat-Under-Irrigated-and-Drought
This dataset is from a field experiment conducted to evaluate physiological responses of bread wheat genotypes under irrigated and drought-stressed environments. The study focused on measuring Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Canopy Temperature (CT) at different growth stages to assess variation in stress tolerance and identify potential drought-resilient genotypes.
